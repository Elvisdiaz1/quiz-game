        <p>
          Welcome to the coding quiz game! Try to answer the following questions
          within the time limit. The next question will appear when you choose
          the correct answer. When you answer all the questions, your score will
          be the time left on the timer and you can save the score to complete
          against your friends or aim to get a better score. If you choose the
          incorrect answer, your time limit will decrease. If you do not answer
          all the questions in time, you lose. Try your best and have fun! (You
          may need to hit the choices two times as the quiz is still a little
          buggy)
